Jukebox MP3 player

This project will show you how to modify some parts for this nice jukebox (not my design) to convert a wind up music box player to a MP3 player that will shuffle music on a micro-SD card.  This is a very basic player, it shuffles the music and lights up a LED ring in the base of the jukebox.  The source is available on Github.

It uses an ESP8266 and DY-SV5W music card.  A schematic is included for the wiring, itâ€™s only a few wires and should not be difficult for anyone who has some basic soldering skills.  

I have a video on Youtube to explain the entire build from modifying the parts in Bambu Studio to compiling the source code.  The link will be provided soon (still working on it). 

After downloading the project from Github, unzip the file 'jukebox-main' to your default Arduino directory.  Then rename the 'jukebox-main' to 'jukebox'.
